# String_Integer_LCD_Interface
This project demonstrates displaying strings and integers on a 16x2 alphanumeric LCD using the LPC2129 (ARM7) microcontroller, programmed in Embedded C with Keil µVision IDE. The LCD is interfaced in 8-bit mode using Port 0 for data lines and control pins RS and E. The program initializes the LCD, displays the string “Hello World” on the first line, and prints positive and negative integers on the second line. This project helps in understanding LCD interfacing, string handling, and integer-to-ASCII conversion in ARM7-based embedded systems.
